        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A nice mango daiquiri (or you can just call it a smoothie honestly) can be a very nice refresher
            after a long day, especially on a friday or on the weekends. In order to eliminate the use of ice, frozen mango was used instead. 
            You can switch it up whenever you like, but for me, a nice simple mango daiquiri is all I need. It doesn't get any easier than this.
