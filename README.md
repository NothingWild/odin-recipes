# odin-recipes
My second GitHub repo

For my second repo, the odin recipes project, I will be demonstrating what I have learned from the previous lessons of the "Project: Recipes" lesson.

This project will be to build a basic recipe website using the basic HTML and will be updated as I go along with the lessons.
